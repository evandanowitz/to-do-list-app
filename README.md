The To-Do List application project was created using jQuery, one of JavaScript's most popular and widely used libraries. You are able to create To-Do List items by typing in the input field and clicking the button to write them on the page. You then have the ability to eliminate the item by clicking on the "X" next to it. If you have multiple items on your list, you can rearrange them by dragging above or below another item. If you want to cross out items with a strikethrough as you complete tasks, you can do so by double clicking on the item.

The goal behind this project was to create a functional app by taking vanilla JavaScript code and converting it into jQuery code.

This project is dependent upon HTML, CSS, JavaScript and, of course, jQuery.
